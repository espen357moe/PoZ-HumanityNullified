## Verse 1

From our vantage point of Sol

We are in control

*Peculiar creatures*

We have studied you for aeons

You bask in your own glory

Self deception of the highest degree

We offer you our intergalactic sympathy

## Chorus 1

Pride comes before a fall

Creating your own demise

Greed will kill you all

But you insist on closed eyes

## Verse 2

Solution to Sol's infestation

Is eradication

But you amuse us

So we watch you play

## Chorus 2

Pride comes before a fall

Creating your own demise

Greed will kill you all

But you insist on closed eyes

Pride comes before a fall

Creating your own demise

Through avarice your fate was sealed

Nullified humanity is no sacrifice

## Break

You advanced through the ages

No foresight to the later stages

You consumed

You exploited

All in vain

Face extinction

## Outro

Pride comes before a fall x4
